# Introduction
## What is Vue js ?
###  Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs).

It uses a component-based architecture and supports reactive data binding for dynamic UI updates.

Vue is easy to learn, combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in single-file .vue components.

It provides built-in features like directives (v-if, v-for, v-model) and tools like Vue CLI, Vue Router, and Vuex.

Vue is lightweight, flexible, and backed by a strong community with excellent documentation.
